        <p><i>Games, which owns League of Legends, commissioned the winner's trophy known as the Summoner's Cup.
        Riot specified that it should weigh 70 pounds, though the actual weight of the finished cup was reduced so it would not be too heavy to lift in victory.
        The World Championship Cups for 2012 and for 2014 were created by Thomas Lyte.

            The bracket stage started on 3 October in Busan, South Korea, and concluded on 19 October with the grand final hosted at the 45,000-seats Seoul World Cup Stadium,where South Korean team Samsung Galaxy White beat the Chinese team Star Horn Royal Club to become the 2014 League of Legends world champions.
            Riot Games released a skin line for six champions to commemorate Samsung White's victory, which was SSW Singed, SSW Rengar, SSW Talon, SSW Twitch and SSW Thresh.
